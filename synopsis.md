Jongen verovert bezet meisje, maar het achtbaanritje duurt maar even.

Jongen blijft bij een meisje slapen, en stelt zich voor hoe ze ook anders had kunnen zijn.



it's all right ma
I'm only sighing

at dawn my lover comes to me
and tells me of her dreams
with no attempt to shovel the glimpse
into the ditch of what each one means

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force

you can train on down to William's Point
you can rock your feet, you can rock this joint
but oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now
you're gonna have to find another best friend somehow

at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do
they take them to the factories, where the heart attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders, and then the kerosine
is brought down from the castles, by insurance men who go
check to see if nobody is escaping from desolation row

I wish there was something you would do or say
try to make me change my mind and stay
but we never did too much talking anyway
don't think twice it's alright

I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one
and no one is better than you
If you really believe that, you know you have
nothing to win, and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
your sorrow to stem

Er gebeurde o.a. niks
